        <font face="couriernew">HTML is really a very simple language. It consits of ordinary texts, with commands that are enclosed by &quot&lt&quot and &quot&gt&quot characters, or between ann &quot&&quot and a &quot ;&quot . You don't really need to know much HTML to create
            a page, because you can copy bits of HTML from other pages that do what you want, then change the text! This page shows on the left as it appears in your browser, and the corresponding HTML code appears on the right. The HTML commands are
            linked to explanations of what they do.</font>
    </p>
    <br>
    <marquee behavior="Scroll" direction="left">
        <p><b>Line breaks</b></p>
    </marquee>
    <br>
    <p>HTML doesnt only use line breaks for ordinary texts.A white space of any type is treated as a single space. The code type of format can also bhi used in html, For example</p>
    <code>
	<pre>
<li>#include &ltiostream&gt
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;}</li>
</pre>
</code>
    <code>
	<li>(a+b)<sup>2</sup>= a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + 2ab.</li>	
</code>
    <p>If you want to put multiple space entity by multiple times for example, I would like to use more than 3 blank spaces &nbsp here. If you want to use the line break command you can use &quot&ltBR&gt&quot,and for the paragraph break, &quot&ltp&gt&quot
        command, Which will insert a blank line.You can use some of the subscript,superscript and mark features as given below</p>
    <br>
    <p><pre> <sub>1</sub><sup>st</sup> &nbsp 2<sub>nd</sub> &nbsp <mark>Mark</mark> and <strong><i>Emphasized format features</i></strong>
	<br>
 <em><b>Starting and Stopping Commands</b></em>
 </pre>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <pre>
 	      	<font face="Times"> Most HTML Command come in pairs: for example, &quot&H4&gt&quot marks the beginning of a size 4 heading and &quot&/H4&gt&quot marks the end of
it.The closing command is always the same as opening command. The closing command is same as the opening command instead of as &quot/&quot.</font>
 	      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>Modifiers are also used sometimes including the basic command, inside the opening commands &quot&lt &gt&quot.The modifier need not the be repeated in the closing command.</p>
    <h2 align="center">This is a size 1 heading</h2>
    <h3 align="left">This is a size 2 heading</h3>
    <h4 align="right">This is a size 3 heading</h4>
